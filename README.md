# math-notes

Replacement Jupyter_Lab for my math notes, the existing on I had was a collection of too many different things, some of which weren't even math related.  So to solve this, I'm going to break the whole thing up into a couple of different projects.

This one will only contain just my math notes.

## Contents
- Calculus

To start the project, all you should have to run is :
<code>$ docker-compose up</code>
